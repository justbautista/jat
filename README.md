## Inspiration

During times like these, finding a job is on a lot of people's minds. The job search is notoriously stressful and many become unmotivated. But what if we can make it less stressful?

## What It Does

JAT tracks jobs you have applied to. Save the stages you are at in each application and get the total count. Set goals for yourself (apply to 5 jobs/day) and keep your streak. Find jobs and apply on the website.

## How We Built It

We built it using the **MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node)** stack. Also, we used **Auth0** for authentication.

## Challenges

#### 1) Adding real job postings:
- APIs aren't free

- Web scraping had many issues

#### 2) Prioritizing and deciding on features to include

## Accomplishments

#### 1) How much we were able to accomplish in the short time we had:

- The project was pretty ambitious for the time frame so being able to pick main features and deliver (sorta) them is something we are proud of

#### 2) Communication and teamwork:

- We didn't know each other beforehand but we were able to quickly assign roles and tasks and work really well with each other

- Anytime someone needed help we all were there to help solve the problem

## What We Learned

#### 1) We are now git experts:

- In the beginning, we had different setups and levels of understanding of Git, but we were able to figure it out together and follow GitFlow

#### 2) Vite is pronounced "veet"

## What's Next?
What's next for JAT We planned on adding more in-depth analysis of the user's job applications (using AI), helping them improve as a candidate. We can add real job postings. Quick apply feature where a user can apply on JAT and automatically add to their job application tracker. Fix many minor annoyances.
